			Describe one non-technical principle learned from each article that you can apply to your web design workflow. the principle does not need to be explicitly stated in the article, but can also be an idea that was generated from your reading and interpretation of the text.

			From reading these articles, I was able to learn about the key fundamentals of CSS as well as the key areas of modern CSS development. First article was mostly explaining about basic css techniques but the main idea was that I don’t need to commit to memorizing every CSS properties, as long as I understand some fundamental things which will make CSS much easier for me to use. At first when I start learning coding, I was indeed intimidated and even discouraged to learn css by the amount of things I believed that I had to memorize, such as properties, values, syntaxes and so on. Although I did not try to memorize everything explained in this article, I got a good sense of how css functions in overall which allowed me to become more open minded in terms of manipulating css properties. Through reading the second article, I was surprised when I found out that the internet uses three times more energy than all wind and solar power sources worldwide. This made me become interested in designing a "sustainable" website that runs 100% on solar power with its own energy storage if I get a chance to learn how to design it in the future. Lastly, in the third article, there was a question on Safia Abdalla’s tweet asking about what web accessibility should really be about. Although it was a question intended for disabbilities but the solutions that came up was sufficient in making the web a better place for all. After reading this article, I got to rethink about web accessibility and that it is something more than just blind people with screen readers but any users in general. In the future, I want to design a website that is easily accessible for anyone who are willing to visit or use my website.
