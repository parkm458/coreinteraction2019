    <h1>"What Happens When You Create A Flexbox Flex Container?", "What We Mean When We Say “responsive”"</h1>
    <p>
			<i>In your own words, answer the questions posed in each article's title with a minimum of 5 sentences each. What happens when you create a flexbox? What do we mean when we say responsive?</i>
		</p>


		<p>
			Flexbox lay things out along one axis in a flexible manner. When I create a flexbox flex container, the flex layout autometically aligns the items as a group on the main axis and distributes them evenly in a container.
		</p>

		<p>
			I think responsive design is what allows accessibility to users. Responsive design provides the user options that are most suitable to their needs.
