    <h1>Reading 3 </h1>
    <h2>Describe why each writer thinks collecting is important.</h2>
		<ol>
		<li>I was able to relate to Rasheed's childhood because my parents also encouraged me to figure out the answers to my curiosity in order to make sense of the world which made me become independent. I agree to Rasheed that researching information enables deeper understanding as well as further findings of the matter. <div id="highlight">She thinks that collecting is important because she is interested in validating those research she did which allows her to share her archives with other people.</div></li><br>

		<li>I found it interesting how removing yourself and your own stance is a quality that could be used in organizing collections. Also, I agree that "changing environments gives you some perspective to see things from other cultural eyes" since living in 3 different cultural background has allowed me to widen my perspectives. <div id="highlight">Chang thinks that collecting is the important part rather than producing a finalized outcome because he is interested in the culture of hoarding process rather than although he is interested in seeing what it will looks like to melt the stuff.</div></li><br>

		<div id="highlight"><li>Aaron thinks that collecting things and archiving on the internet archive is especially important because internet archive saves everything instead of prioritizing what to save, unlike print pieces which can be destroyed as we don't know what will be valuable in the future.</div> He believes that great works of print that have been archived for a long time should be preserved for longer because they are digital.</li>
