			<p>Although many people are aware that the use of plastic bags should be reduced for the environment, plastic bags are continuously being consumed at a similar rate. In fact, using plastic bags are convenient and practical. Therefore, I came to a conclusion that it might be a more effective resolution to promote a more realistic sustainable idea because it is difficult to not use plastic bags at all. This poster encourages people to take part in making the best use out of leftover plastic bags by using the <i>"Plastic" Bag.</i> I hope that using these bags will <b>reduce the rate of plastic consumption and encourage people to come up with more creative ideas that they could easily put into action in everyday lives.</b></p>

			<p><a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-45509822">‘A single piece of plastic’ can kill sea turtles, says study</a></p>

			<p>I have always been consuming plastic, mostly thrown away after it being used for once. This post was an opportunity for me to rethink about my daily plastic consumption. I think plastic provide us convenience but at the same time it leads to inconvenience in long term. The fact that a single piece of plastic can cause such huge problem on sea turtles where there is a one in five chance of death for a turtle who consumed just one item made of plastic demonstrates the significance of negative impact of plastic on the ecosystem and the reason why we should be more responsible about plastic consumption. As such, we who consume plastic should come up with ideas to regulate the excessive use of plastic and mismanage of them since ecosystem is not only for human but for every creatures including sea turtles. It is true that we are currently not directly exposed to the inconvenience to the point where sea turtles are experiencing but we need to think more sustainably and be more responsible in our consumption and treatment of plastic.</p>

			<h3>Process</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>I had to make several different versions with different temperatures of the iron to figure out the best way to attach the layers together.</li>
				<li>It was more difficult to stick one layer on top of the ones that had already been ironed.</li>
