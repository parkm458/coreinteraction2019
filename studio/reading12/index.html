    <h1>Fuck Content</h1>
    <p>
			"The meaning of his work is not in the story but in the storytelling." was very inspiring to me. Designers are those who work with the devices of telling rather than the story itself. Just like how every film is about filmmaking, children's books can be exemplified as what the "storytelling" heavily relies on as much as the "story" itself in the publication process. For instance, a good childrenâ€™s book with illustrations that go well with the story in the style of children's taste would be a successful children's book no matter parents like it or not. Therefore, designers must master the visual devices that delivers the content and communicates with the users/viewers.
