    <h1>A Handmade Web</h1>
    <h2>J.R. Carpenter</h2>
    <p>
			<i>"I evoke the term 'handmade web' in order to draw attention both to the manual labour involved in the composition of web pages, and the functioning of the web page itself as a 'manual', a 'handbook', a set of instructions required for a computer program to run."</i>
			<br><br>
			The fact that any readers can become writers and that identities can be expressed through a handmade web was very interesting when I read this article. As a coding student, we learn how to compose a website and we get inspirations from other existing websites by inspecting the source code used in the web page. I also believe that handmade websites should be maintained longer so that everyone can benefit from using it as a tool in the handcrafting of new materials and sharing them further.
