    <h1>Research & Destroy A Plea for Design as Research</h1>
    <h2>Daniel van der Velden</h2>
    <p>The role of the designer is in danger in the creative industry. “A pioneering designer does more than just design – and it is precisely this that gives design meaning.” Designers doing things besides designing can further advance himself as innovative designers, such as Willem Sandberg who worked in the combined role of graphic designer and director of the Amsterdam Stedelijk Museum. I think that one of the biggest reasons behind his success was that he was his own client. Instead of carrying out whatever the client dictates, designers should completely throw themselves into their own personal and independent production of knowledge to “redesign” themselves as what Daniel van der Velden said.</p>
