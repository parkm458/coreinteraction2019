    <h1>Can Jokes Bring Down Governments?</h1>
    <p>
			Memes are created to act as “political posters”.  It was very new to find out that there are three qualities needed for successful memes: longevity, fecundity, and copying fidelity, because I have never thought that memes would incorporate such complex and meaningful intentions.<br><br>The way how word ‘meme’ was created was very interesting to me. In fact, the word is abbreviated from ‘Mimeme’ which came from a Greek root but Dawkins who introduced the notion of meme as a “cultural gene” wanted the word to sound like ‘gene’.
