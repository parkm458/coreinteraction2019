    <h1>Conditional Design</h1>
    <p>
			Karl Gerstner claims that graphic designer as a problem solver in this reading. It was interesting to find out that describing a problem is part of the solution. I was able to relate the idea intricately to my own design process, because in fact, clear understanding of the problem is always the main factor of solving the problem.

			The quote, "Contemporary designers make tools that enable others to use design, they create systems to engage the intrinsic complexity of technology and life." is saying that designers design designing. I also believe that not only the production of objects but designers should further share and distribute the production.
